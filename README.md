# Planetesimal, Inc

## An asteroid mining services provider, featuring Near Earth Objects using NASA API.

This is a project built for an imaginary business that specializes in mineral prospecting of asteroids on approach to Earth.
Under the **Prospective Asteroids** tab in the navbar, a table is generated using an API from NASA's JPL Asteroid Team:

- Retrieves names of each asteroid
- Determines the closest approach from the list of dates
- Estimates a total value in USD based on the diameter of the object and its potential composition
